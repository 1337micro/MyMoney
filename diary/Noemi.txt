January 17, 2018 (Lab 1)
	first meeting at the lab
	Yanzhen Li not present (updated teams on January 18, saw they dropped)
	we assigned roles for everyone/everyone decided their role & team agreed
	I added everyone on Facebook and made a Facebook group and Sabrina did a list with everyone’s emails that was posted on the FB group
	We discussed about the project basic requirements
	We decided to communicated via Discord to allow screensharing and other very useful utilities it has.
	William created the git repository with folders

	We agreed on these basic options to do throughout the project:
		cash spending (transactions details, input, ouput)
		budgeting (amount, set a percent for groceries, rent ,etc)
		credit cards, debits, loyalty cards (display like a bank application, very visual not much options for the user)

	We learned about domain model.
	I decided to do a plan of what the desktop application could look like.
	I did some basics coding to provide the team with a possible outcome:

	I worked on the use case template to have an idea for the domain model according 	to the template the TA showed us during the tutorial yesterday.
	I worked another sample of how the application could look
	The Team approved the design of the application I did and Tiantian completed the U	User Case Template.
	I posted on GitHub the design.
	After collecting and reviewing every teammate’s schedule, I could tell when we can 	almost all meet:
	I created a Google Drive Folder with all necessary documents and shared it with 	every teammates so they can add, modify documents.
	Tiantian proposed a Use Case with Latex.
	William modified my code to make it clearer, separating, identifying variables.
	William made a video to explain us how to use Git
	Genevieve made a schedule to follow for the first iteration

January 25, 2018
	I checked what has been done during the lab yesterday as I was sick to go. I keep 	up with what has been done.
	During the week I ask question about William code for the feature Cash Spending 	and ask him to make sure he had comments done.
	I also made sure Sabrina was up to date with her feature.
	I check with Genevieve if she was doing okay with My Cards feature and I suggested 	that she uses a Grid Layout so it could be more simple for her to place her 		components.

	I helped Genevieve with the My Cards features by providing a sample of the output.

	I started to do the code for the iteration 2 for the my Cards feature.
