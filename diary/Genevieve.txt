Lab 1
Since I joined the class the day before I did not have an assigned team. I ended working with PB-PK at the recommandation of the TA. 
Yanzhen Li was absent.
We assigned roles, gave each other our contact informations.
We discussed the features we wanted to have on our application and it's basic requirement. 
Noemi made a facebook group
Sabrina made a discord Channel
William made the git repository
I put my schedule on the facebook group and emailed the prof to know if I would be officially assigned to the team.

I made myself a git account and gave it to William so that he could add me on the git repository.
Discussed with team members on discord. Roles of Ornela and Tiantian have been changed. 
Tiantian's friend joined our team. Noemi made sure she had all the information to add to our contact information file.
