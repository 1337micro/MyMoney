Lab 1
Since I joined the class the day before I did not have an assigned team. I ended working with PB-PK at the recommandation of the TA. 
Yanzhen Li was absent.
We assigned roles, gave each other our contact informations.
We discussed the features we wanted to have on our application and it's basic requirement. 
Noemi made a facebook group
Sabrina made a discord Channel
William made the git repository
I put my schedule on the facebook group and emailed the prof to know if I would be officially assigned to the team. 

Journal entry 18/01/2018
I made myself a git account and gave it to William so that he could add me on the git repository.
Discussed with team members on discord. Roles of Ornela and Tiantian have been changed. 
Tiantian's friend joined our team. Noemi made sure she had all the information to add to our contact information file.

Noemie worked on the cards feature during the weekend as it is the most complex feature. She helped with the implementation of the database and improving the layout of the cards. I have the JUnits, fixing the behavior of the cards feature when clicking cancel and removing the extra field present in the UI left to do.Goal of the night: fixing UI. Tomorrow do JUnit. by Wednesday everything should be done and ready for QC to do their part and verifying that everything matches. I will later have to update my journal and put it on latex.
